> **What is a Crawler Agent?**
>
> A crawler agent is a community‑driven component responsible for discovering, retrieving, and extracting manga metadata from a specific online source. It serves as the integration layer between KamiYomu and external manga websites, enabling access to a broad range of content.
>
> Any developer can create a crawler agent and publish it to any NuGet feed, such as nuget.org, GitHub Packages, BaGet, and others.
>
> KamiYomu acts as the orchestrator for crawler agents, coordinating their capabilities—such as fetching, listing, and searching manga entries. It also manages the execution of crawler functions and handles image downloads provided by each agent.
