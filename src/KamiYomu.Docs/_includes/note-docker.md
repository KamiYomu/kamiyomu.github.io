> **What is Docker?**
> Docker is a platform that uses containers to package an application and all its dependencies (code, runtime, libraries, settings) into a single, lightweight, and isolated executable unit.
> In a few words, Docker ensures your application "runs the same everywhere", whether on your laptop, a testing server, or a production environment.
> The goal of using Docker for KamiYomu is to provide you with the simplest possible installation experience, guaranteeing that the application works correctly without any complicated setup.
> This is a great choice if you want to install KamiYomu into a NAS (Network Attached Storage)
